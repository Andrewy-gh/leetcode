// 771. Jewels and Stones
// Easy

// You're given strings jewels representing the types of stones that are jewels, and stones representing the stones you have. Each character in stones is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

// Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".



//   Example 1:

// Input: jewels = "aA", stones = "aAAbbbb"
// Output: 3

// Example 2:

// Input: jewels = "z", stones = "ZZ"
// Output: 0



// Constraints:

// 1 <= jewels.length, stones.length <= 50
//     jewels and stones consist of only English letters.
//     All the characters ofÂ jewels are unique.
